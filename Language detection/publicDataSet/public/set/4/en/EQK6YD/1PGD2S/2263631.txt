Kissing Point is a point on the Parramatta River about 2 km south of Ryde, located in the suburb of Putney.  Historically, the name referred to a much wider area than the current-day point; and perhaps originally to the point near Ryde Bridge where Settlers Park is now located, and where a 1948 brass plaque by the Council states "THIS IS THE SITE OF THE FIRST SETTLEMENT ON 10th JANUARY 1792 - BY - WILLIAM CARELESS and JAMES WEAVERS IN THE LOCALITY SET UP BY GOVERNOR PHILLIP AS FARMS OF THE EASTERN BOUNDARY (LATER CALLED KISSING POINT)".
