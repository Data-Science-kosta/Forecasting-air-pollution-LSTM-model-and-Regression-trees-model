VESA Stereo is a liquid crystal shutter glasses interface standard by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) for stereoscopic 3D displays. The system does not drive the glasses directly, instead providing a basic signal and power to be used by other electronics either inside the glasses or in  an external unit.
The VESA Stereo connector has been extensively used in 3D accelerators as well as 3D DLP TVs.
