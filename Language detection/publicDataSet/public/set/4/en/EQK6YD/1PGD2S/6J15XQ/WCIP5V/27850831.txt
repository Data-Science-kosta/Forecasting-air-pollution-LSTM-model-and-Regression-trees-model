The Lake County Courthouse, in Crown Point, Indiana, is also referred to as the "Grand Old Lady".  It is a combination of architectural styles, including Romanesque and Georgian. It was designed in 1878 by J. C. Cochran of Chicago, Illinois.Lake County was organized in 1837 and a small log structure was used as the courthouse. At the time the county was created, three towns were vying to be the County Seat, Lake Court House (the name for Crown Point), Liverpool and West Point.  In 1839 the County Commissioners picked Liverpool as the County Seat. Local dissatisfaction brought the state into the process and the following year, (1840) Lake Court House was selected. Solon Robinson and Judge William Clark, with County Agent George Earle gave a Lake Court House a new name. In 1868 the town was incorporated as Crown Point.

Meanwhile, in 1849 the log courthouse was replaced by a frame building at a cost of $10,000. By 1876 the frame courthouse was too small. A prominent Chicago architect designed a larger and more ornate building. The central portion, including the clock tower, was started in 1878 and dedicated in 1880. The cost was $52,000.00. The brick facade is made of local bricks from the Henry Wise brickyard.  The towers were added in 1907 and dedicated in 1909.  The additional cost was $160,000.00.
